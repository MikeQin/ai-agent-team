## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI installed and configured
- Access to the AI Agent Team repository
- Basic understanding of software development concepts

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai-agent-team
   ```

2. **Review the Architecture**
   ```bash
   # View the visual architecture
   open AI-Agent-Team.drawio.svg
   
   # Read the complete PRD
   cat prd.md
   ```

3. **Start with Requirements Gathering**
   ```bash
   # Invoke Will (Product Owner) to gather requirements
   claude-code --agent po
   ```

4. **Follow the Workflow**
   Each agent builds on the previous agent's output:
   - Will → Mike → Jennifer/Amy/Sarah → Bob/Jim/Luke → Vijay → Alex

### Usage Examples

#### Example 1: E-commerce Platform

```bash
# 1. Gather requirements with Will
claude-code --agent po
# User describes: "I need an e-commerce platform with mobile app and admin dashboard"

# 2. Design architecture with Mike
claude-code --agent architect
# Reviews PRD, designs system architecture

# 3. Design mobile UI with Jennifer
claude-code --agent mobile-ui-designer
# Creates mobile-first designs based on architecture

# 4. Continue through the workflow...
```

#### Example 2: SaaS Application

```bash
# Full workflow for a SaaS application
claude-code --agent po              # Requirements gathering
claude-code --agent architect       # System design
claude-code --agent security-engineer # Security architecture
claude-code --agent web-ui-designer # Web interface design
claude-code --agent web-developer   # Web development plan
claude-code --agent backend-developer # API development plan
claude-code --agent qa-tester       # Testing strategy
claude-code --agent devops-engineer # Deployment strategy
```
