# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Overview

The AI Agent Team project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security policies, procedures for reporting vulnerabilities, and security best practices for contributors and users.

## 📋 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | :white_check_mark: |
| develop | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use one of the following methods:

### 1. GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)
- Go to our [Security Advisories page](https://github.com/ai-agent-team/ai-agent-team/security/advisories)
- Click "Report a vulnerability"
- Fill out the form with detailed information

### 2. Private Email
- Send an email to: security@ai-agent-team.org
- Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

### 3. Encrypted Communication
For highly sensitive issues, you can use our PGP key:
- Key ID: [TO BE ADDED]
- Fingerprint: [TO BE ADDED]

## 📝 What to Include in Your Report

Please include as much information as possible:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., prompt injection, code execution, data leakage)
- **Affected components** (which AI agents or system components)
- **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested mitigation** (if you have ideas)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

## 🔄 Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability within 5 business days
3. **Resolution**: We will work on a fix and keep you updated on progress
4. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate public disclosure with you
5. **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer anonymity)

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

- **Code Review**: All code changes require review before merging
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
- **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive data
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all inputs to AI agents
- **Output Sanitization**: Ensure agent outputs don't contain sensitive information

### For Users

- **Environment Security**: Run agents in secure, isolated environments
- **Input Sanitization**: Be cautious with sensitive data in agent inputs
- **Output Review**: Review agent outputs before using in production
- **Access Control**: Limit agent access to necessary files and systems only
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the AI Agent Team system updated

## 🤖 AI Agent Security Considerations

### Prompt Injection Prevention
- Agents are designed with input validation and output constraints
- System prompts are protected from user manipulation
- Agent instructions are isolated from user inputs

### Data Protection
- Agents operate on structured data formats
- Sensitive information should be masked in inputs
- Generated outputs are sanitized for common security issues

### Tool Access Control
- Each agent has limited tool access based on their role
- File system access is restricted to designated directories
- Network access is controlled and logged

## 🔍 Security Testing

We implement multiple layers of security testing:

### Automated Security Scans
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Static code analysis for security issues
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection in dependencies
- **Secret Scanning**: Detection of committed secrets or sensitive data
- **Container Scanning**: Security analysis of Docker images

### Manual Security Reviews
- **Agent Configuration Review**: Regular audits of agent permissions and capabilities
- **Workflow Security Assessment**: Analysis of agent interaction patterns
- **Prompt Injection Testing**: Testing for prompt manipulation vulnerabilities
- **Output Validation Testing**: Verification of output sanitization

## 📊 Security Metrics

We track and monitor:
- Number of security vulnerabilities reported and resolved
- Time to patch security issues
- Security scan results and trends
- Agent permission usage and anomalies

## 🔄 Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: Contain and assess the impact
2. **Investigation**: Determine root cause and affected systems
3. **Mitigation**: Deploy fixes and protective measures
4. **Communication**: Notify affected users and stakeholders
5. **Post-Incident Review**: Document lessons learned and improve processes
