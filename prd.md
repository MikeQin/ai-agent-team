# AI Agent Team - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
The AI Agent Team is a coordinated multi-agent system that automates the complete software development lifecycle from requirements gathering through production deployment. Each specialized agent performs specific roles in a defined workflow, producing structured deliverables that feed into subsequent development phases.

**Goal**: Create a comprehensive AI-powered development team that can take user requirements and produce fully documented, architected, tested, and production-deployed software solutions across mobile, web, and backend platforms.

## Project Overview
Build an intelligent agent orchestration system with 10 specialized sub-agents that collaborate to deliver complete software projects. The system follows a waterfall-inspired workflow where each agent's output becomes input for downstream agents.

**Reference Architecture**: `AI-Agent-Team.drawio.svg` provides the visual blueprint for agent relationships and data flow.

### Quality Standards
- **Validation**: Each agent must validate input dependencies exist before execution
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure modes when dependencies are missing
- **Consistency**: Uniform output format across all generated artifacts
- **Traceability**: Clear references between dependent artifacts

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All 10 agent definition files created in `.claude/agents/`
- [ ] Agent workflow successfully processes user input through all stages
- [ ] Generated artifacts are properly structured and cross-referenced
- [ ] Database strategy implemented (SQLite for POC, PostgreSQL for production)
- [ ] Security architecture integrated throughout development lifecycle
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline and deployment strategy defined
- [ ] Project documentation (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) complete
- [ ] Repository is GitHub-ready with proper structure
- [ ] End-to-end testing validates complete workflow

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: Each agent should complete tasks within 5 minutes
- **Reliability**: 95% success rate for complete workflow execution
- **Scalability**: Support concurrent execution of parallel agents (UI designers, developers)

### Security Considerations
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs in Product Owner agent
- **Output Sanitization**: Ensure generated code follows security best practices
- **Access Control**: Restrict agent file system access to designated directories

### Documentation Deliverables
- **README.md**: Getting started guide with usage examples
- **CLAUDE.md**: Agent configuration and customization guide  
- **Architecture Documentation**: Complete system overview and integration patterns
