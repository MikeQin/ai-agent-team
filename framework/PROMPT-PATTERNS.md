# AI Agent Team Prompt Patterns Guide

**Crystal Clear Commands for Design vs Development**

---

## üéØ **Two-Mode Operation**

The AI Agent Team now operates with explicit **DESIGN PHASE** and **DEVELOP PHASE** to eliminate confusion and ensure you always know what you're doing.

## üèóÔ∏è **DESIGN PHASE Patterns**

**Purpose:** Create comprehensive planning documents and system architecture

### **üÜï CLI Flags Method (Recommended):**
```bash
claude --design --agent [agent-name] "[description]"
```

### **Traditional Method (Still Supported):**
```bash
claude --agent [agent-name]
# Prompt: [DESIGN PHASE] [description]
```

### **Examples:**

#### **Backend Development Planning:**
```bash
# RECOMMENDED: CLI Flags Method (Crystal Clear)
claude --design --agent backend-developer "Plan the ExpenseFlow backend architecture with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and authentication system"

# ALTERNATIVE: Traditional Method (Still Supported)
claude --agent backend-developer
# Prompt: [DESIGN PHASE] Plan the ExpenseFlow backend architecture with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and authentication system
```

#### **Frontend Development Planning:**
```bash
# RECOMMENDED: CLI Flags Method (Crystal Clear)
claude --design --agent web-developer "Design the Next.js web application architecture with dashboard, analytics, and real-time features"

# ALTERNATIVE: Traditional Method (Still Supported)
claude --agent web-developer

```

## üíª **DEVELOP PHASE Patterns**

**Purpose:** Implement actual working code following design specifications

# Prompt: [DEVELOP PHASE] Create Docker containers and Kubernetes manifests for production deployment
```

## üîÑ **Mode Detection Examples**

### **Automatic Mode Detection**

**DESIGN PHASE Triggers:**
- `[DESIGN PHASE]` in prompt
- Keywords: "plan", "design", "architecture", "strategy", "framework"
- Phrases: "create a plan for", "design the system", "architect the solution"

**DEVELOP PHASE Triggers:**
- `[DEVELOP PHASE]` in prompt  
- Keywords: "implement", "code", "build", "create", "write"
- Phrases: "implement the feature", "build the component", "write the code"

### **Example Conversations:**

#### **Design Phase Example:**
```bash
# RECOMMENDED: CLI Flags Method (Crystal Clear)
claude --design --agent backend-developer "Plan a REST API for expense management with user authentication"
# Luke: "I'm in DESIGN PHASE. I'll create a comprehensive backend development plan in design-phase/BACKEND-DEV.md..."

# ALTERNATIVE: Traditional Method (Still Supported)
claude --agent backend-developer
# User: [DESIGN PHASE] Plan a REST API for expense management with user authentication
# Luke: "I'm in DESIGN PHASE. I'll create a comprehensive backend development plan in design-phase/BACKEND-DEV.md..."
```

#### **Implementation Phase Example:**
```bash
# RECOMMENDED: CLI Flags Method (Crystal Clear)
claude --develop --agent backend-developer "Implement the login endpoint with JWT token generation"
# Luke: "I'm in DEVELOP PHASE. Let me first read design-phase/BACKEND-DEV.md to understand my implementation plan, then I'll write the actual FastAPI code..."

# ALTERNATIVE: Traditional Method (Still Supported)
claude --agent backend-developer
# User: [DEVELOP PHASE] Implement the login endpoint with JWT token generation
# Luke: "I'm in DEVELOP PHASE. Let me first read design-phase/BACKEND-DEV.md to understand my implementation plan, then I'll write the actual FastAPI code..."
```

## üéØ **Best Practices**

### **Design Phase Best Practices:**
1. **Start with Requirements:** Always begin with the Product Owner (po) agent
2. **Follow Dependencies:** Architect ‚Üí UI Designers/Security ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí QA ‚Üí DevOps
3. **Be Comprehensive:** Create detailed specifications that guide implementation
4. **Consider All Aspects:** Security, performance, testing, deployment from day one

### **Implementation Phase Best Practices:**
1. **Reference Design Documents:** Agents automatically read their own plans first
2. **Be Specific:** Request specific features rather than entire systems
3. **Iterate Incrementally:** Build features one at a time, testing as you go
4. **Cross-Validate:** Use multiple agents to validate implementations

# After implementing a feature, validate with related agents
claude --develop --agent security-engineer "Review the authentication implementation for security compliance"
claude --develop --agent qa-tester "Create tests for the newly implemented authentication system"

# ALTERNATIVE: Traditional Method (Still Supported)
# claude --agent security-engineer
# Prompt: [DEVELOP PHASE] Review the authentication implementation for security compliance
```

claude --develop --agent backend-developer "Add email verification to user registration"
claude --develop --agent backend-developer "Implement password reset functionality"

# ALTERNATIVE: Traditional Method (Still Supported)
# claude --agent backend-developer

## üí° **Key Benefits of This Pattern**

1. **üéØ Crystal Clear Intent:** No confusion about what you're doing
2. **üîÑ Consistent Behavior:** Agents behave predictably based on phase
3. **üìö Automatic Context:** Agents know which documents to reference
4. **‚úÖ Self-Validation:** Agents follow their own design specifications
5. **üöÄ Efficient Workflow:** Seamless transition from planning to implementation
